## Canvas

Experiments related to canvas:

1. **easeljs** – EaselJS API experiments. Trying to understand does this lib fit our.

1. **blur** – Discovered very fast bluring technique that in theory can run in runtime.

1. **videoblur** – [Demo](http://a-ignatov-parc.github.io/experiments/canvas/videoblur/) showing previosly dicovered bluring technique trying to blur video in realtime.

1. **jstopng** – [Demo](http://a-ignatov-parc.github.io/experiments/canvas/jstopng/) showing how text can be converted to `png` image. With ability to restore text from previously generated image.


## Tag
Created simple constructor that can emulate DOM tree operating with Objects.
